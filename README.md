# Tier Sense

A Flutter based tiering app with eSense compatibility.

## Getting Started

This app was created with Google's UI toolkit [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). For help getting started with Flutter, view [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Furthermore, Food Sense supports multi-sensory earables from [eSense](https://www.esense.io/) to swipe between cards. Here you can find a [manual](https://www.esense.io/share/eSense-User-Documentation.pdf) to quickly get started with eSense. Additionally, eSense offers also a Flutter plugin for both Android and iOS which you can find [here](https://pub.dev/packages/esense_flutter).
