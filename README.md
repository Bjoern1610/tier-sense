# TierSense

A Flutter based tiering app with eSense compatibility. The app was created for the [Mobile Computing and Internet of Things](https://pcs.tm.kit.edu/962_984.php) course at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

## Getting Started

This app was created with Google's UI toolkit [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). For help getting started with Flutter, view [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Furthermore, TierSense supports multi-sensory earables from [eSense](https://www.esense.io/) to swipe between cards. Here you can find a [manual](https://www.esense.io/share/eSense-User-Documentation.pdf) to quickly get started with eSense. Additionally, eSense offers also a Flutter plugin for both Android and iOS which you can find [here](https://pub.dev/packages/esense_flutter).
